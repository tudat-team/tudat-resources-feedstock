:: *********************************************************** 
::
:: This script downloads the raw data files distributed manually as release on 
:: the tudat-resources Github repository and places them in $HOME/.tudat/resource
:: directory on the host machine. 

:: This script is written precisely to download the data files distributed 
:: directly as GitHub releases, because in the future, Github would block pushing
:: data files > 100 MB to the repository, so they need to be distributed as
:: releases-only. 
:: In order for this script to function correctly, upload only a single zip file
:: with the name <resource> containing all the sub directories with the data 
:: files, i.e., the resource/ in master, or the data/ in develop.
::
:: The script is run automatically by conda as the last step in the installation
:: process of the conda package tudat-resources on the host machine.
